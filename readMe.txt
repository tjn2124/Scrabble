dictionary.txt

The file dictionary.txt contains all of the words in the 
Official Scrabble Player’s Dictionary, Second Edition.


WordLists.java

WordLists, in Java generates useful word lists for scrabble players using
the Official Scrabble Player’s Dictionary.
I start by creating an array list from the dictionary.txt file
for efficiency. This is to avoid going through the dictionary file every time
each method needs to check certain words. In the last three methods the
chars are compared lexicographically to check whether the user argument
is a lower case letter.
